<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Why is everyone forced to enjoy esports from the sidelines? 
We all dreamt of making a living playing competitive video games, and we're putting that power in your hands.
Bootstrap your own esports career and wager your winnings to climb the ranks!

Esports is what makes the competitive gaming community such an amazing place to compete, connect, and profit. We all dreamt of living the life of an celebrity built through our **own successes**.

It's time to bootstrap your esports career. No longer do we live in times of major organizations and massive corporate buyouts steering the ship of competitive gaming. We are building a platform to climb the ranks, be placed in regional ladders, climb to national ladders, all while wagering your winnings for even larger rewards and reach!
